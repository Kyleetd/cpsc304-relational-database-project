# CPSC 304 Project 

## Summary
Our project aims to store and track data related to users’ fitness regimes. Users are composed of people looking to introduce an element of consistency and organization to their workouts such that they can clarify their progress and personal targets. The database models users, workouts, exercises, exercise logs, fitness goals, achievements, physical measurements, and gym locations.

## What it does
Our project is an administrative tool designed to manage and organize data related to users' fitness regimes. It provides a comprehensive system for storing and tracking information, allowing administrators to effectively monitor and support users in their fitness journeys. The tool encompasses various database models, including users, workouts, exercises, training plans, fitness goals, achievements, physical measurements, and gym locations. With this tool, administrators can facilitate consistency and organization in users' workouts, enabling them to track progress, set personal targets, and achieve their fitness goals more effectively. A specific example of an application of our project is for personal trainers to log information associated with their clients. For example a personal trainer could use this app to track and update their clients’ measurements as their fitness progresses.

## How we built it
HTML and CSS was used to develop the frontend interface. For the backend, we used PHP for server-side scripting, SQL for interacting with the Oracle Database, and the Oracle DBMS for storing and retrieving data.
